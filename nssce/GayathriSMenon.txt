Hi, Gayathri here and I am...

...2nd year Computer Science Engineering student who likes to code and connect with people. I completed my schooling in UAE and yes, I love to travel and make memories.
...passionate about the environment and love to volunteer. In my free time, I love to read, cook, hear music, draw portraits and write. I am a mental health advocate and also worked for MindChamps, creating inclusive content in the field of mental health.
