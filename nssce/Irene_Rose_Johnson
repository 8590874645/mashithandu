Hi, I am Irene 😁
I am a second-year student opting for B.tech Information Technology 😊.
I would like to contribute to open source and this is a great opportunity for that!
A curious girl trying to unlock all the hidden talents within 😊.
I do vector arts, web development and a constant crave to learn something new (That's why I am here🤓).
